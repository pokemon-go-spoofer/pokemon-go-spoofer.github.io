## Spoof your **location** in Pokemon GO

Pokemon GO location spoofer is a new app that allows you to change your location and spoof your GPS signal so you can catch Pokemon in other parts of the world. The app is available for iOS and Android devices, and it’s easy to use. All you have to do is enter the desired location and hit “Start.” Your phone will then start sending false GPS signals to the game server, and you’ll be able to catch Pokemon in any part of the world. The app has already been downloaded by thousands of people, and it’s quickly becoming one of the most popular ways to cheat at Pokemon GO. Some people are using it to travel to different parts of the world, while others are using it to find rare Pokemon that they wouldn’t normally be able to catch.

## About the location spoofer

There are a number of ways that people have been cheating the Pokemon GO location tracking system. One popular method is to use a location spoofer. This tool tricks the game into thinking you are in a different location, allowing you to catch rarer creatures or take advantage of advantageous gym situations. While some players see this as cheating, others see it as a way to level the playing field for those who live in rural areas or who don’t have the time to travel long distances in search of Pokemon.

## New Release

A location spoofer for the popular augmented reality game “Pokemon GO” has been released, much to the dismay of Niantic Labs, the game’s developer. The app, called “PokeGoAnywhere,” was created by Brian Hanrahan and allows users to change their location on the map to anywhere in the world. This allows them to bypass any restrictions that might be in place at their current location, such as not being able to catch certain types of Pokemon. PokeGoAnywhere is available on Github for free. Niantic has responded to the release of PokeGoAnywhere by issuing a statement saying that they are working on a fix for the app and that it violates their terms of service. They also say that they are working on new features that will make it more difficult for people to cheat at the game.
