Pokemon GO location spoofer is a new app that allows you to change your location and spoof your GPS signal so you can catch Pokemon in other parts of the world. The app is available for iOS and Android devices, and it's easy to use. All you have to do is enter the desired location and hit "Start." Your phone will then start sending false GPS signals to the game server, and you'll be able to catch Pokemon in any part of the world.

The app has already been downloaded by thousands of people, and it's quickly becoming one of the most popular ways to cheat at Pokemon GO. Some people are using it to travel to different parts of the world, while others are using it to find rare Pokemon that they wouldn't normally be able to catch.
